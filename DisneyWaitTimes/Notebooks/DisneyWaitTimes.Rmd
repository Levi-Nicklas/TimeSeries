In this notebook we will take a in depth look at Disney World wait times. 

## Splash Mountain

![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-_LSILuiWnhM%2FUf6lAf8cH-I%2FAAAAAAAAI98%2FeLRkdxHyqGE%2Fs1600%2FSplashMountainposter.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

First I am going to take a look at splash mountain wait times. Looking at this data I am immediately curious about the disparity in the posted vs. actual wait times. When you wait on a 45 min ride, some times you get to the ride in 30 mins and some times it takes an hour; should there be a better estimate at wait times? Is the current posted wait time good enough?

```{r, message = F}
splash_mtn <- readr::read_csv("../raw-data/splash_mountain.csv")
colnames(splash_mtn) <- c("date","datetime","actual","posted")

splash_mtn %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("actual", "posted")) %>% 
  mutate(datetime = lubridate::as_date(datetime)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  filter(value > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(datetime, value, color = as.factor(name))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~name, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  labs(color = "", title = "Splash Mountain - Wait times")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

At first look, it appears that the wait times that are posted are often higher than the actual wait times. Perhaps this is a matter of managing expectations. If we decompose the time series maybe we will see something interesting. I expect to see some seasonality where the wait times are higher in the summer than the winter. 

```{r}
splash_mtn_tdy <- splash_mtn %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("actual", "posted"))

# Clean out duplicates
splash_mtn_tdy %>% 
  filter(name == "actual") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  duplicates()

# Clean out any duplicate or incorrect data.
splash_mtn_tdy_act <- splash_mtn_tdy %>% 
  filter(name == "actual") %>% 
  mutate(flag = ifelse(lubridate::mdy(date) == lubridate::date(datetime),1,0)) %>% 
  mutate(datetime = lubridate::ymd_hm(substring(datetime,1,16))) %>% 
  filter(flag == 1) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(datetime) %>% 
  summarize(value = mean(value))
  

dcmp_spl_mtn <- splash_mtn_tdy_act[1:1825,] %>% 
  as_tsibble() %>% 
  tsibble::fill_gaps() %>% 
  mutate(value = ifelse(is.na(value),0,value)) %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(datetime)) %>%
  model(STL(value ~ season("month", window = "periodic"))) 
  
 
components(dcmp_spl_mtn) %>% autoplot()

splash_mtn_tdy_act[1:1825,] %>% 
  as_tsibble() %>% 
  tsibble::fill_gaps() %>% 
  mutate(value = ifelse(is.na(value),0,value)) %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(datetime)) %>%
  gg_season(value)

```
